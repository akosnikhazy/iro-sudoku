My old JavaScript sudoku game

In 2013 I was just started to grasp JavaScript. I wanted to try pure JavaScript after I was very comfortable with jQuery. Also wanted to move to HTML5 games as Flash seemed like a bad bet for the future. I was failed some at the jQuery part. Newgrounds started to let us upload HTML based games, so I wanted to do something like this. This is how this happened. I did not changed the code, added some fresh comments. Everything stayed as is. 

It is not the best solution for a sudoku.
